                As a self-taught aspiring software engineer I value each opportunity to apply
                my skills, face challenges, and learn from obstacles. At my current job I learned
                that it was possible to automate work tasks using scripts with Python.  This
                created a desire to learn the possiblities of software engineering.  In March 2020
                I created a web application using Django, Celery, PostgreSQL.  It housed basic
                CRUD functions to store and track court bookings infractions and based off those
                records, you were able to select which emails would be automated and sent out to
                members.
